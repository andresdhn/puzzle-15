# puzzle-15
15 puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.

Some time ago I was tasked with this project with 3 days to complete. I decided to create this in Vanilla JS, 
using the revealing module pattern and custom styles with Sass. 

This Puzzle in particular, can receive the number of columns/rows to play with as a parameter and rebuilds dynamically.
